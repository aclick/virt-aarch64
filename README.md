# virt-aarch64
This repo contains my scripts for creating and initializing an emulated aarch64 machine running Arch Linux ARM. I'm mostly interested in getting this running as a way of avoiding cross-compilation while I mess with [Sony's Camera Remote SDK](https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/sdk/en/index.html).
